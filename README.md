Pablo's Very Useful Scripts
===========================

This repository contains a collection of Shell, Python, Perl scripts that I
(Pablo) keep in my `~/bin` directory, which is, in turn, an early entry in my
`$PATH` environment variable.  There might also be the occasional Windows batch
or power-shell script.  Most (but not all) of the scripts are used for software
development, and most (but not all) of those scripts are specific to my local
copy of the Bloomberg development environment.

Nevertheless, I have chosen to make this repo public to make it easy to share
scripts that I think others would be interested in.  Feel free to copy
individual files or fork the entire repository.  If I feel especially
industrious, I might even add a descriptive table of contents to this README
file, but don't hold your breath.
