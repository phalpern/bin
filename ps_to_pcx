# This is just an example of how to do it.
#
# To find other formats (other than pcxgray), type "ps" and at the interactive
# prompt, type "devicenames ==".
#
# Example of converting a postscript file to a 2550x600 pcx file at 300 dpi:
gs -sDEVICE=pcxgray -g2550x600 -r300 -sOutputFile=embossed.pcx embossed.ps.prn < /dev/null
